Makes extensive use of the fast neural style library backing the paper from Fei Fei Li, appearing at ECCV 2016. See https://github.com/jcjohnson/fast-neural-style for code and more details on the library.

Note that "Post to Facebook" and "Set as cover photo" require facebook verification, which we're still waiting on! You can see our styles applied to your profile picture in the meantime though, and download directly yourself.

We use one more python wrapper not appearing here to run the Deep Learning code on our AWS GPUs -- happy to provide on request.
